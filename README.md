# Projectile-simulation
The objective of this program is to compute the trajectory of an object launched under an angle with a specific initial velocity and experiencing a quadratic drag force and the presence of wind.

To solve this problem we implemented runge kutta 4, numeric method that we used to solve the systems of ordinary differential equations necessaries to make the simulation. 

You can run this project using the "make" command.
